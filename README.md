## Critical discourse analysis of geotagged tweets using methodology from corpus linguistics
These scripts were created for streaming tweets, dividing them into subcorpora and then analysing them.
The collected data itself is limited to use in projects related to the course I wrote these scripts for; this repository is primarily for reference.
